## 1. Euclidean

Euclidean distance is a similarity measure that calculates the straight-line distance between two points in a space. 

It represents the physical distance between two vectors and is primarily concerned with differences in magnitude.

![Euclidean](euclidean_graph.png)

### Key Characteristics

Mathematical Foundation
The measure is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, calculated as the square root of the sum of differences between two vectors.

The formula is:

$
  \begin{equation}
    d_E(i,j)
      = \left(
        \sum_{k=1}^{p}(
          x_{ik}-x_{jk}
        )^2\right
      )
    ^{\frac{1}{2}}
  \end{equation}
$

### Properties

- Scale-invariant and based purely on vector differences.
- Requires numerical data type vectors.
- Works better in lower-dimensional spaces.
- Requires data normalization for effective results.

### Use Cases

- Understanding continuous dataset structures.
- K-means clustering and classification tasks.
- Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering1
Limitations.
- Effectiveness decreases with higher dimensionality due to the curse of dimensionality.
- May not perform well with sparse data5
Sensitive to the magnitude of vectors.

## 2. Cosine

Cosine similarity is a mathematical metric that measures the similarity between two non-zero vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them in a multi-dimensional space

### Mathematical Foundation

The formula is expressed as:

$
  \begin{equation}
  \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{B}\|}
  \end{equation}
$

### Value Range

- Ranges from -1 to 1.
- Value of 1 indicates identical orientation.
- Value of 0 indicates perpendicular vectors.
- Value of -1 indicates opposite orientation.

### Advantages

**Orientation Focus:**

- Measures similarity based on direction rather than magnitude.
- Particularly effective for high-dimensional spaces.
- Less sensitive to absolute values of vector components.

**Practical Benefits:**

- Low computational complexity for sparse vectors.
- Effective for text analysis and document comparison.
- Works well in information retrieval and recommendation systems.

**Limitations:**

- May not be effective with sparse data.
- Focuses only on orientation, ignoring absolute magnitudes.
- Requires non-zero vectors in an inner product space.

## 3. dotProduct

The dot product similarity is a fundamental metric that measures the similarity between vectors by calculating the sum of their corresponding element products.

### Mathematically

The formula is expressed as:

$
  \begin{equation}
    \text{dotProduct} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i
  \end{equation}
$

### Value-Range

- Ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity.
- Positive values indicate vectors pointing in similar directions.
- Zero indicates perpendicular (orthogonal) vectors.
- Negative values indicate opposing directions.

## Key Characteristics

- **Scale Sensitivity:**

> - Affected by both vector magnitude and direction.
> - Larger values indicate greater similarity.
> - Sensitive to the absolute size of vector components.

- **Applications:**

> - Commonly used in Large Language Models.
> - Effective for recommendation systems using collaborative filtering.
> - Particularly useful when vector magnitude carries meaningful information.

### Relationship to Cosine Similarity

The dot product is closely related to cosine similarity through the formula:

$
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = \|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{B}\|\cos(\theta)
  \end{equation}
$

Where Î¸ is the angle between the vectors. This relationship shows that dot product combines both directional similarity and magnitude information in its measurement.
